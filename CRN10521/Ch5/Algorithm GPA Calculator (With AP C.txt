Algorithm GPA Calculator (With AP Classes)

1. Import Scanner class
2. Define class CalculateGPAWeighted
3. Define method: main
	4. Create a Scanner object
	5. Prompt user for number of classes
	6. Assign number of classes to variable of type int (numClasses)
	6a. Declare and initialize gradePoint of type double
	7. Engage a for-loop using numClasses as the loop end criteria
		8. Prompt user for name of class
		9. Assign name to variable of type String (className)
		10. Prompt user for letter grade
		11. Assign grade to variable of type char (grade)
		12. Implement a switch to add to gradePoint based on grade
		13. Extract first three characters in className (substring method)
		14. Implement an if-statement to check for "AP ", & grade == 'A' or 'B'
			15. Add 1 to gradePoint if true
	16. Calculate GPA (gradePoint/numClasses)
	17. Display GPA to user.
